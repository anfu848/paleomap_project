# paleomap_project

This is a project to create a map program that will cycle between various maps depicting the Earth throughout its geologic history.
Maps used are found from the PALEOMAP Project, by Christopher R. Scotese (http://www.scotese.com)

The program uses Python Tkinter to create the GUI and PIL to manipulate the images.
